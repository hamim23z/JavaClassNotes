**Conditional and Ternary Operators**
    This is the shorthand for if .. else statements

    - System.out.println(studentGrade >=60 ? "Passed" : "Failed");

    If the student grade is in fact greater than or equal to 60, it will print out Passed. If it
    is not, then it will print out Failed


**Local Variables in Method Main**
    Variables declared in a method body are local variables and can be used only from the line
    of declaration to the closing right brace of the declaration
    Declaration must appear before the variable is used in that method
    Cannot be accessed outside the method


**Increment v Decrement**
    ++ adds one
    -- subtracts one

    If it's placed before, then its a prefix inc or dec. And after is postfix inc or dec

    If we do ++a or --a then it means that we increment/decrement by 1, then use the new value
    of a in the expression where a resides in. 
    If we do a++ or a--, then it means we use the current value of a in the expression in which
    a resides in, then we increment/decrement by 1.
