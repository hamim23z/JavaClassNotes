**Java Comments**
    A single comment is started off with //
    A multiline comment is started off with /* and ended with */


**Using Blank Lines**
    Good for making programs easier to read
    Whitespace is ignored by the compiler. 


**Declaring a Class**
    - public class class_name

    Every Java program has at least one class that we define
    We need the class keyword before the class name always
    A public class must be placed in a file that has a file name of the form class_name.java


**Names and Identifiers**
    Classes begin with a capital letter and we capitalize the first letter of each word (if it has multiple)
    A class name is an identifier
    Java is case sensitive


**Declaring a Method**
    - public static void main(String[] args)

    This is the starting point of every Java application
    Parenthesis after the identifier main means its a program building block called a method
    Java class declarations normally contain one or more methods


**Java Output**
    To give output to the console, we use 
    - System.out.println(Something in here)
    
    Most statements end with a semicolon in Java, not just the output by the way


**Java Input**
    - import java.util.Scanner;
    - Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    - int number1;
    - System.out.print("Enter first number: ")
    - number1 = input.nextInt(); //reads first integer from the user


**Escape Sequences**
    New line characters can be used by using System.out.println. When we use System.out.print it keeps it on the same line. 
    We can also use the default \n for it

    Backslash \ and tab \t are two more common ones


**Displaying Text with printf**
    - System.out.printf 

    This means that the output will be formatted
    %s is a placeholder for a string
    %d is a placeholder for a decimal integer

    - System.out.printf(%s%n%s%n, "Welcome to", "Java Programming!");


**Arithmetic Precedence**
    Multiplication, division, and remainder is first
    Addition and subtraction is second
    Assignment is last
